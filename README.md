# Unique Cafe – Ordering System (Python)

## Project Description
This is a simple Python console-based restaurant ordering system.  
It allows users to select food items from a menu and calculates the total bill amount based on the selected items.

This project is designed to demonstrate basic Python programming concepts using a real-world scenario.

---

## Features
- Display menu with prices
- Order multiple items
- Menu stored using dictionary
- Continuous ordering using loop
- Automatic total bill calculation
- User-friendly console interaction

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Dictionary
- While loop
- Conditional statements
- User input handling

---

## Menu
| Item   | Price (Rs) |
|-------|------------|
| Pizza | 240 |
| Pasta | 140 |
| Burger | 80 |
| Salad | 120 |
| Tea | 40 |
| Coffee | 60 |

## How to Run the Project
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Open terminal / command prompt
4. Run the program using:

```bash
python cafe_management_system.py
```
---

## Program Logic
- Menu items and prices are stored in a dictionary
- User selects an item from the menu
- If the item exists, its price is added to the total bill
- The program continues until the user chooses "No"
- Final bill amount is displayed

## Sample Output
```
Welcome to the Unique Cafe
Menu:
Pizza: Rs240
Pasta: Rs140
Burger: Rs80

Do you want to order another item? Yes
Enter the item you want to order: Tea
Tea added to your order.

Total amount to pay: Rs280
```
